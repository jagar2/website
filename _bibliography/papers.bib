               It is challenging to make ML models fail because statistical
               correlations can mimic the physics without causality. Here,
               using a benchmark band-excitation piezoresponse force microscopy
               polarization spectroscopy (BEPS) dataset the pitfalls of the
               so-called ``better'', ``faster'', and ``less-biased'' ML of
               electromechanical switching are demonstrated and overcome. Using
               a toy and real experimental dataset, it is demonstrated how
               linear nontemporal ML methods result in physically reasonable
               embedding (eigenvalues) while producing nonsensical eigenvectors
               and generated spectra, promoting misleading interpretations. A
               new method of unsupervised multimodal hyperspectral analysis of
               BEPS is demonstrated using long-short-term memory (LSTM)
               $\beta$-variational autoencoders ($\beta$-VAEs) . By including
               LSTM neurons, the ordinal nature of ferroelectric switching is
               considered. To improve the interpretability of the latent space,
               a variational Kullback-Leibler-divergency regularization is
               imposed . Finally, regularization scheduling of $\beta$ as a
               disentanglement metric is leveraged to reduce user bias.
               Combining these experiment-inspired modifications enables the
               automated detection of ferroelectric switching mechanisms,
               including a complex two-step, three-state one. Ultimately, this
               work provides a robust ML method for the rapid discovery of
               electromechanical switching mechanisms in ferroelectrics and is
               applicable to other multimodal hyperspectral materials

               devices in extreme environments. Device performance and energy
               efficiency is highly correlated to clock frequency, operational
               voltage, and resistive loss. To increase performance it is
               common to engineer ferroelectric domain structure with
               highly-correlated electrical and elastic coupling that elicit
               fast and efficient collective switching. Designing domain
               structures with advantageous properties is difficult because the
               mechanisms involved in collective switching are poorly
               understood and difficult to investigate. Collective switching is
               a hierarchical process where the nano- and mesoscale responses
               control the macroscopic properties. Using chemical solution
               synthesis, epitaxially nearly-relaxed (100) BaTiO3 films are
               synthesized. Thermal strain induces a strongly-correlated domain
               structure with alternating domains of polarization along the
               [010] and [001] in-plane axes and 90° domain walls along the
               [011] or [01 1 \textasciimacron{} $\bar\{1\}$ ] directions.
               Simultaneous capacitance-voltage measurements and
               band-excitation piezoresponse force microscopy revealed strong
               collective switching behavior. Using a deep convolutional
               autoencoder, hierarchical switching is automatically tracked and
               the switching pathway is identified. The collective switching
               velocities are calculated to be $\approx$500 cm s-1 at 5 V (7 kV
               cm-1 ), orders-of-magnitude faster than expected. These

Beyond traditional applications as nonvolatile capacitive elements, the interplay between polarization and electronic transport in ferroelectric thin films has enabled a path to neuromorphic device applications involving resistive switching. 
  A fundamental challenge, however, is that finite electronic conductivity may introduce considerable power dissipation and perhaps destabilize ferroelectricity itself. 
  Here, tunable microwave frequency electronic response of domain walls injected into ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate (PbZr<sub>0.2</sub>Ti<sub>0.8</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) on the level of a single nanodomain is revealed. 
  Tunable microwave response is detected through first-order reversal curve spectroscopy combined with scanning microwave impedance microscopy measurements taken near 3 GHz. 
  Contributions of film interfaces to the measured AC conduction through subtractive milling, where the film exhibited improved conduction properties after removal of surface layers, 
  are investigated. Using statistical analysis and finite element modeling, we inferred that the mechanism of tunable microwave conductance is the variable area of the domain wall in the switching volume. 
  These observations open the possibilities for ferroelectric memristors or volatile resistive switches, localized to several tens of nanometers and operating according to well-defined dynamics under an applied field.",

               unstructured structural and functional images are acquired;
               however, only an infinitesimally small fraction of this data is
               rigorously analyzed, with an even smaller fraction ever being
               published. One method to accelerate scientific discovery is to
               extract more insight from costly scientific experiments already
               conducted. Unfortunately, data from scientific experiments tend
               only to be accessible by the originator who knows the
               experiments and directives. Moreover, there are no robust
               methods to search unstructured databases of images to deduce
               correlations and insight. Here, we develop a machine learning
               approach to create image similarity projections to search
               unstructured image databases. To improve these projections, we
               develop and train a model to include symmetry-aware features. As
               an exemplar, we use a set of 25,133 piezoresponse force
               microscopy images collected on diverse materials systems over
               five years. We demonstrate how this tool can be used for
               interactive recursive image searching and exploration,
               highlighting structural similarities at various length scales.
               This tool justifies continued investment in federated scientific

              the Materials Genome Initiative (U.S.), Materials Informatics
              (U.S.), the Materials Project (U.S.), the Open Quantum Materials

              ferroelastic domains on the pyroelectric and electrocaloric
              response is experimentally investigated in thin films of the
              tetragonal ferroelectric PbZr0.2 Ti0.8 O3 . By utilizing
              epitaxial strain, a rich set of ferroelastic polydomain states

              concentration of defects on film interfaces and surfaces that
              limit the scope of systems that can be produced and studied
              experimentally. Here, we developed an ion-beam based subtractive
              fabrication process that enables creation and modification of
              thin films with pre-defined thicknesses. To accomplish this we
              transformed a multimodal imaging platform that combines
              time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry with atomic force
              microscopy to a unique fabrication tool that allows for precise
              sputtering of the nanometer-thin layers of material. To
              demonstrate fabrication of thin-films with in situ feedback and
              control on film thickness and functionality we systematically
              studied thickness dependence of ferroelectric switching of
              lead-zirconate-titanate, within a single epitaxial film. Our
              results demonstrate that through a subtractive film fabrication
              process we can control the piezoelectric response as a function
              of film thickness as well as improve on the overall piezoelectric
              response versus an untreated film.",

              characterization of materials by scientists worldwide. The
              long-held belief of ambient AFM is that the tip is generally
              chemically inert but can be functionalized with respect to the
              studied sample. This implies that basic imaging and scanning
              procedures do not affect surface and bulk chemistry of the
              studied sample. However, an in-depth study of the confined
              chemical processes taking place at the tip-surface junction and
              the associated chemical changes to the material surface have been
              missing as of now. Here, we used a hybrid system that combines
              time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry with an atomic
              force microscopy to investigate the chemical interactions that
              take place at the tip-surface junction. Investigations showed
              that even basic contact mode AFM scanning is able to modify the
              surface of the studied sample. In particular, we found that the
              silicone oils deposited from the AFM tip into the scanned regions
              and spread to distances exceeding 15 $\mu$m from the tip. These
              oils were determined to come from standard gel boxes used for the
              storage of the tips. The explored phenomena are important for

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

               It is challenging to make ML models fail because statistical
               correlations can mimic the physics without causality. Here,
               using a benchmark band-excitation piezoresponse force microscopy
               polarization spectroscopy (BEPS) dataset the pitfalls of the
               so-called ``better'', ``faster'', and ``less-biased'' ML of
               electromechanical switching are demonstrated and overcome. Using
               a toy and real experimental dataset, it is demonstrated how
               linear nontemporal ML methods result in physically reasonable
               embedding (eigenvalues) while producing nonsensical eigenvectors
               and generated spectra, promoting misleading interpretations. A
               new method of unsupervised multimodal hyperspectral analysis of
               BEPS is demonstrated using long-short-term memory (LSTM)
               $\beta$-variational autoencoders ($\beta$-VAEs) . By including
               LSTM neurons, the ordinal nature of ferroelectric switching is
               considered. To improve the interpretability of the latent space,
               a variational Kullback-Leibler-divergency regularization is
               imposed . Finally, regularization scheduling of $\beta$ as a
               disentanglement metric is leveraged to reduce user bias.
               Combining these experiment-inspired modifications enables the
               automated detection of ferroelectric switching mechanisms,
               including a complex two-step, three-state one. Ultimately, this

Beyond traditional applications as nonvolatile capacitive elements, the interplay between polarization and electronic transport in ferroelectric thin films has enabled a path to neuromorphic device applications involving resistive switching.

  Here, tunable microwave frequency electronic response of domain walls injected into ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate (PbZr<sub>0.2</sub>Ti<sub>0.8</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) on the level of a single nanodomain is revealed. 
  Tunable microwave response is detected through first-order reversal curve spectroscopy combined with scanning microwave impedance microscopy measurements taken near 3 GHz. 
  Contributions of film interfaces to the measured AC conduction through subtractive milling, where the film exhibited improved conduction properties after removal of surface layers, 
  are investigated. Using statistical analysis and finite element modeling, we inferred that the mechanism of tunable microwave conductance is the variable area of the domain wall in the switching volume.

  abstract  = "AbstractIn pursuit of scientific discovery, vast collections of
               unstructured structural and functional images are acquired;
               however, only an infinitesimally small fraction of this data is
               rigorously analyzed, with an even smaller fraction ever being
               published. One method to accelerate scientific discovery is to
               extract more insight from costly scientific experiments already
               conducted. Unfortunately, data from scientific experiments tend
               only to be accessible by the originator who knows the
               experiments and directives. Moreover, there are no robust
               methods to search unstructured databases of images to deduce
               correlations and insight. Here, we develop a machine learning
               approach to create image similarity projections to search
               unstructured image databases. To improve these projections, we
               develop and train a model to include symmetry-aware features. As
               an exemplar, we use a set of 25,133 piezoresponse force
               microscopy images collected on diverse materials systems over
               five years. We demonstrate how this tool can be used for
               interactive recursive image searching and exploration,
               highlighting structural similarities at various length scales.
               This tool justifies continued investment in federated scientific
               databases with standardized metadata schemas where the
               combination of filtering and recursive interactive searching can
               uncover synthesis-structure-property relations. We provide a
               customizable open-source package
