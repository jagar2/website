  abstract = {In this community review report, we discuss applications and
              techniques for fast machine learning (ML) in science-the concept
              of integrating powerful ML methods into the real-time
              experimental data processing loop to accelerate scientific
              discovery. The material for the report builds on two workshops
              held by the Fast ML for Science community and covers three main
              areas: applications for fast ML across a number of scientific
              domains; techniques for training and implementing performant and
              resource-efficient ML algorithms; and computing architectures,
              platforms, and technologies for deploying these algorithms. We
              also present overlapping challenges across the multiple
              scientific domains where common solutions can be found. This
              community report is intended to give plenty of examples and
              inspiration for scientific discovery through integrated and
              accelerated ML solutions. This is followed by a high-level
              overview and organization of technical advances, including an
              abundance of pointers to source material, which can enable these
              breakthroughs.},
